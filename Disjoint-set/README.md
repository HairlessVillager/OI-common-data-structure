## How to use this module?

1. Add the `#include "Disjoint-set.cpp"` at the beginning of the code.
2. Use the `findRoot(int index)` to find the root of the `index`.
3. Use the `isSameRoot(int index1, int index2)` to learn whether `index1` and `index2` have the same root (that is means there is relationship between `index1` and `index2`) or not.
4. Use the `merge(int index1, int index2)` to produce relationship between `index1` and `index2`.
